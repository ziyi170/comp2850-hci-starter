# Week 9 Evaluation Planning Sketch

## Events to Log

Based on backlog priorities:
- Task creation (time, validation errors)
- Task deletion (confirmation shown?)
- Filter usage (reset frequency)
- Keyboard navigation (Tab presses per task)

## Metrics to Capture

- **Time-on-task**: How long to add/edit/delete?
- **Error rate**: How often do validation errors occur?
- **Completion rate**: Can people complete tasks without help?
- **Confidence ratings**: Post-task subjective feedback

## Test Scenarios

1. Add 3 tasks (test confirmation feedback)
2. Delete task with keyboard only (test accessibility)
3. Filter then page-reload (test filter persistence)
